# Simulations of optical manipulation 

These scripts are simulations of optical manipulations, including optical tweezers and radiation pressures. Currently, the codes are only applicable to Mie scattering ($r_{radius} > \lambda$).

This simulation is based on the publication from publication [Ren, K. F., G. Gréhan, and G. Gouesbet. "Evaluation of laser-sheet beam shape coefficients in generalized Lorenz–Mie theory by use of a localized approximation." JOSA A 11, no. 7 (1994): 2072-2079.](https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-11-7-2072)

The simulation has been made as a parallel computing manner with output as an Excel file. This calculation is applicable to both focused Gaussian beam and light-sheet beam, with emphasize on radiation pressure calculations.
